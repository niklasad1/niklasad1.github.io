<h2>About</h2>
Hi, I'm Niklas and I'm a 28-year-old Swedish guy who loves to code. I grew up and live in a city named Borås in Sweden, one of Sweden's rainiest cities near Gothenburg. Currently, I work as an embedded software developer at Cybercom where I primary write C and C++. I consider myself as a programming enthusiast and my biggest interests are software security, systems programming, programming languages, Internet-of-Things and distributed systems. 

<h2>Background</h2>
I got into computers when I was quite young and I was hooked directly. 
The first computer I ever used was a Windows 93 machine that my dad bought and on that, I played a lot of games but I didn't get into programming before I started at the University. 

Back in 2013, I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at University of Borås. 
After that, I started working at RISE (former SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden) as dependability engineer primary working with functional safety and information security. 
After working in about 3 years I took time off to pursue a Masters in Computer Science with specialization in computer security and distributed systems which I have a passion for. 
Also, I wanted to improve abilities because I worked with some brilliant people that made me realize that I needed to understand certain aspects from the ground up better. 
In 2017, I graduated with a Masters degree in Computer Science from Chalmers University.
