<h2>About</h2>
Hi, I'm Niklas and I'm a 28-year-old Swedish guy who loves to code. I grew up and live in a city named Bor√•s in Sweden, one of Sweden's rainiest cities near Gothenburg. Currently, I work as an embedded software developer and in my daily job I mostly write C/C++. However, I enjoy a variety of different programming languages such Rust, Python, Java and Haskell. I consider myself as a programming enthusiast and my biggest interests are at the moment software security, systems programming, crypto, Internet-of-Things and distributed systems. 


A part from sitting in front of alot of computers I also enjoy playing golf. When I was younger I used to compete at amature level and 
the lowest handicap I reached was 3. For now I don't play at that level anymore and only for fun.
