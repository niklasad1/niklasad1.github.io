<h2>About</h2>
Hi, I'm Niklas and I'm 28 years old Swedish guy who loves to code that grew up in a city named Borås, one of Sweden's rainiest cities near Gothenburg. Currently, I work as embedded software developer at Cybercom where I primary write C and C++. Moreover, I'm interested in software security, systems programming, programming languages, Internet-of-Things and distributed systems. 

<h2>Background</h2>
I got into computers when I was quite young and I was hooked directly. 
The first computer I used was a Windows 93 machine that my dad bought on that I played a lot of games but I didn't get into programming before I started at the University. 

Back in 2013, I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at University of Borås. 
After that, I started working at RISE (former SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden) as dependability engineer with work that included functional safety and information security. 
After working in about 3 years I took time off to pursue a Masters in Computer Science with specialization in computer security and distributed systems which I have a passion for. 
Also, I wanted to improve abilities because I worked with some brilliant people that made me realize that I needed to understand certain aspects from the ground up. 
In 2017, I graduated with a Masters degree in Computer Science from Chalmers University 

Besides computer related topics when I was younger used to compete in golf and I
was pretty good when I was around 18 years old. I ended up at third place at local
club championship and the lowest handicap I reached was 3.
